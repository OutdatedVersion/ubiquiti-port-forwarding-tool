# Gated port forwarding

> [!NOTE]  
> This is a work-in-progress! ðŸ¦ºðŸ™‚

Provides a way to expose a limited interface to expose ports in a network
using a Ubiquiti router running Unifi OS' Network app.

I've given out some virtual machines, running in [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview), to friends which don't
have any way to forward traffic to them. Since publicly exposing and handing
out credentials to people didn't seem like a great idea this bridges that gap.
